# sit746_code
Code and scripts for my sit 746 thesis for reproducibility (to be added soon)
SingleStockKFohlcvCuilogr.py contains the environment class script for running the main experiments with Cui et al (2023) as a baseline.
SingleStockohlcvCuilogr_no_kalman.py contains the environment class script for running the ablation experiment with the removal of the Kalman Filter.
In the case Yahoo Finance is down, I have uploaded all excel files of all the OHCLV data used in this experiment. You can directly import the excel files
into Python using pandas.
